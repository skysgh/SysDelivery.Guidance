## Synopsis ##

Guidance, Reference Data, and Templates to use to develop elited desires into formal requirements. 

## Background ##

The IIBA's BABOK defines 4 key types of requirements:

* **Business Requirments**, capturing the Why
* **Stakeholder Requirements**, capturing how people expect to contribute to the above outcome,
* **System Requirements**, capturing what to build to deliver the capabilities to stakeholders, and to what level of quality
* **Transitional Requirements**, capturing how to transition from the current state to the target state.

[Guidance](./00.Guidance/readme.md) is provided on how to build these different types of requirements.
